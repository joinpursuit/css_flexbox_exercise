# CSS Flexbox

The best way to learn Flexbox is to play [Flexbox Froggy](
    
) all the way through.

Once you've done that, take a look at `index.html` in this folder. Update the CSS file so that each box:

- Is arranged in a row, wrapping when the window gets smaller than the total width of the elements.
- Is ordered according to the color of the elements - all `red` divs should be first, then `yellow`, then `blue`.
- If the window is larger than the total width of the elements, they should be evenly spaced across the window.

Please do this _without changing the HTML at all_.
